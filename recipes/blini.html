        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a quick recipe that teaches you how to make Russian pancakes â€” blini. Blini are different to traditional
        American pancakes because they are much thinner and use a more liquid-like batter than American pancakes. Like the 
        buterbrod recipe, blini on their own, although delicious, are very simple. You can experiment with many different fillings, 
        such as sour cream, jam, sour cream with jam, or maybe even some smoked salmon or caviar, if you're feeling luxurious.
