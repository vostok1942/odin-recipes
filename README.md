# odin-recipes

This is my first project on The Odin Project and GitHub! It is an 
HTML website with some simple recipes. This website will require me to use
the skills I have learned so far on The Odin Project, including writing the 
HTML boilerplate, adding links and images to the page, using paragraphs, and 
adding headings to the website. Furthermore, I will also be using Git and 
GitHub to keep a history of my files.
